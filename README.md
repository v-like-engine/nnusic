# nnusic
Artificial Intelligence way to compose the music needed to focus, relax or sleep

# FAQ

## What is the main idea behind this project, why is it needed?
> This project will be an application for music generation.
> You will be able to compose accompaniment for your future song, a new motif, or a vibe music for focus/relaxation/sport/sleeping/etc.
> The main goal is to replace expensive pay-to-play music services, such as brain fm and others. 
> No offense to those services, they are exellent, but some users do not have a possibility to pay. nnusic will solve this problem for some users.

## Where is the code?
> If the code was not uploaded yet, it is still reviewed on a local machine before the first transfer to github, because it was started locally.
> The transferring process was started on 20th of March 2023, it may take some time.

## What stage this project is on currently?
> The project was started in the beginning of March 2023.
> At the moment it is on it's first MVP (generation of simple piano tracks using LSTM and small dataset to train on).

## Which architectures are used/will be used in this project?
> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture is used for training and generating.
> Other architectures may be used to classify tracks of the dataset.
> Another LSTM may be used to name tracks (to generate titles for them, as an NLP model I have used in my past projects, see Parodia_)

## What are the plans?
> The next MVP is expected to consist of generational algorithm for different musical styles and instruments. Stay tuned!
